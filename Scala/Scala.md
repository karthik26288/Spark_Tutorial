## Scala Overview

* Scala is general purpose programming language.
* Scala is an object-oriented and functional programming language.
* Scala is modern multi paradigm and hybrid programming language.
* Scala designed inspired by Java and Lisp.
* Scala is Scalable language.
* Scala runs on top of Java Platform i.e., JVM.
* Scala is a strong static type language.
* In scala, everything is an object whether it is a function or a number. 
* Scala does not have support primitive data types.
* Scala was designed by Martin Odersky. 
* Scala was officially released for java platform in early 2004.
* Scala source file having an extension of either .scala or .sc.
* Scala is interactive programming language.
* Scala allows development in two ways:
  * Interactive Mode
  * Standalone
* We can use Scala for developing following type of applications.
  * Web applications
  * Enterprise applications
  * Mobile applications
  * Desktop applications
  * Data Analysis applications
  * Utilities and Libraries
  * Streaming Applications
  * Parallel and batch processing applications
  * etc...
* Scala is crisp, productive and easy to learn.
* Scala is not extension of Java, but it is interoperable with Java.
* Scala is pure object oriented and functional oriented programming language.
* Scala is a pure object oriented language in the sense that every value is an object
* Scala is pure functional language in the sense that every function is a value.

#### Scala Hello World Progrom:
```
  Interactive Mode using scala, scala notebook, zeppelin etc...
  
     println("Hello World")
     
  Standalone Mode:
  
  object HelloWorld {
    def main(args:Array[String]) {
       println("Hello World")
    }
  }
```
**************
## Scala Features:
* Type inference: Scala offers Type Inference i.e., no need to provide the data type explicitly
* Singleton objects: Scala offers Singleton i.e., no static members.
* Immutability: Scala offers Immutability i.e., can not modify variable values.
* Lazy computation: Scala offers Lazy computation i.e., it evaluates expressions only when they are required.
* Case classes and Pattern matching: Scala case classes are regular classes but there are immutable. Scala case classes are used in combination with Scala pattern matching.
* Concurrency control: Scala provides actor model for better handling of Concurrency.
* String interpolation: Scala String interpolation allows embedding variables as part of Scala string.
* Higher order function: Scala offers high order functions i.e., function takes another function as argument or function returns another function as return value.
* Traits: Scala provides trait which contains fields and methods of type abstract and non abstract.
* Rich collection set: Scala provides a rich set of mutable and immutable collections to manipulate the data.
* Closures: Scala offers ananymous functions
* etc...


********************
## Scala Variables and Data Types
* Scala allows two types of variables i.e., val and var
* val is constant i.e., immutable
* var is modifiable i.e., mutable.

```
val name = "Naga"
name = "Ravi" // This throws error

var age = 30
age = 35 // This works
```
* The following are standard data types in Scala which are similar to Java. The only difference is which are Objects rather than primitives.
  * Byte
  * Short
  * Int
  * Long
  * Float
  * Double
  * String
  * Char
  * Boolean
  * Null
  * Nothing
  * Any
  * AnyRef
  * AnyVal
  * etc...

*******************
## Scala Control structures:
* Scala offers the following control structures which are used control flow of Scala program.
  * Conditional Statements
    * if, if-else, nested if-else, if-else ladder
  * Scala Pattern Matching
  * Scala loops

#### Conditional Statements:
##### if-statement
```
   Syntax:
   if(<condition>){
    statements...
   }
```
##### if-else statement
```
if(<condition>){
 statements...
}else{
 statements....
}
```
##### if-else ladder
```
if(<condition>){
 statements...
}else if(<condition>){
 statements....
}else if(<condition>){
 statements..
}else{
 statements....
```
*Note: Use Ternary operator instead of if-else statements i.e., ```<condition> ? <true case> : <false case>```*
#### Scala Pattern Matching:
* Scala pattern matching is alternative to switch statement.
```
variable match {
case 1 => statements
case 2 => statements
case 3 => statements
case _ => statements
}
```
#### Loops
* while loop
* do while loop
* for loop
```
while loop:

while(<condition>){
 statements
}

do-while loop:

do{
 statements
}while(<Condition>)

for loop:

for(i <- range){
 statements
}

for(i <- ScalaCollection){
 statements...
}
```

*********************
## Scala Comments
* Scala supports thre types of comments
  * Single line ```//```
  * Multi line ```/*....*/```
  * Documentation ```/** **** */```
  
***************
## Scala Functions
* Scala supports functional programming
* Scala has lot of builtin functions and also supports for user defined functions.
* Scala Functions are first class values.
* Store Scala Function as value
* Every value in Scala is an Object i.e., Scala function also an Object.
* Scala allows passing a function as method/function argument and return function as another function return value.
* Scala functions are defined with keyword *def* like in Python and Ruby.

#### Scala Function Definition:
```
def functionName([funcParams : typeofparameters]) : [returntypeoffunction] = {  
statements...
[(return_value)]
}
```
#### Higher Order Functions:
* Scala higher order function is a function that either takes a function as argument or returns a function
```
def functionName(<another function>) : <another function> = {
 statements.....
}

```

****************************
## Scala Classes and Objects
* Scala is pure Object oriented programming language
* Object is a real world entity. It contains state and behaviour
* Class is a blueprint/template of an Object.
* Scala class contains the following things:
  * Data member
  * Member method
  * Constructor
  * Block
  * Nested class
  * Super class information
* In Scala, the default scope is public

```
Class:

class Employee{
var name:String = null
var age:Int = 0
}

Object

object EmpExample{
 def main(args:Array[String]) {
  val emp = new Employee()
  println(emp.name)
  println(emp.age)
 }
}


class Employee(name:String, age:Int){
 def getName():String = {
  (name)
 }
 def getAge():Int = {
 (age)
 }
}

Object

object EmpExample{
 def main(args:Array[String]) {
  val emp = new Employee("Naga", 30)
  println(emp.name)
  println(emp.age)
  println(emp.getName)
  println(emp.getAge)
  println(new Employee("Rajesh", 40).getName()) // Ananymous Object
 }
}
```
### Singleton and Companion object
* Singleton object is an object which is declared by using object keyword instead by class.
* In Scala, there is no static concept. So scala creates a singleton object to provide entry point for your program execution.
* Methods declared inside Singleton Object are accessible globally.
* Singleton object can extend classes and traits.
```
object SingletonObjectName {
variables + methods
}
```
* In scala, when you have a class with same name as singleton object, it is called companion class and the singleton object is called companion object.
* Both the companion class and its companion object both must be defined in the same source file.
```
Hello.scala

object Hello {
 def main(args:Array[String]){
   val hello = new Hello()
   hello.message()
 }
}

class Hello {
 def message(){
  println("Hello")
 }
}
```
### Scala Case class and Case Object
* Scala case classes are just regular classes which are immutable by default and decomposable through pattern matching.
* Scala case class uses equal method to compare instance structurally. 
* Case class does not use new keyword to instantiate object.
* All the parameters listed in the case class are public and immutable by default.

```
case class Person(name:String, age:Int)

object PersonExample {
 def main(args:Array[String]){
  val person = Person("Naga", 30)
  println(person.name)
  println(person.age)
 }
}
```
### Scala case class and pattern matching:
```
abstract class Notify
case class Email(from:String, to:String, message:String) extends Notify
case class SMS(to:String, message:String) extends Notify
case class Alert(message:String) extends Notify

def sendNotification(notification:Notify) : Unit = notification match{
    case Email(from, to, title) => println("You got a mail")
    case SMS(to, msg) => println("You got an SMS")
    case Alert(msg) => println("You got an Alert")
    case _ => println("No Event")
}

val email = Email("abc@gmail.com", "xyz@gmail.com", "HI How are you?")
sendNotification(email)
```
### Scala Constructors:
* Scala provides primary and auxiliary constructors.
#### Scala default primary constructor:
* This is the default constructor, no need to specify the default primary constructor.
```
class Employee{
 println("Employee...")
}

object Emp{
  def main(args:Array[String]){
   val emp = new Employee()
  }
}
```
#### Scala primary constructor:
* Scala allows to define primary constructor with zero or more parameters with definition of the class.
```
class Employee(name:String, age:Int){
 def getName(): String = {
  (name)
 }
 def getAge(): Int = {
  (age)
 }
}
```
#### Scala Secondary or auxiliary Constructor:
* We can create any number of auxiliary constructors in a class.
* We must call primary constructor from inside the auxiliary constructor.
* this keyword is used to call constructor from other constructor.
```
class Employee(name:String, age:Int){
 var place = ""
 def this(name:String, age:Int, place:String){
     this(name, age)
     this.place = place
 }
 def getName(): String = {
  (name)
 }
 def getAge(): Int = {
  (age)
 }
 def getPlace():String = {
     (place)
 }
}

object Emp {
def main(args:Array[String]){
val emp = new Employee("Naga", 30)
val employee = new Employee("Ravi", 33, "Mysore")
println(emp.getName())
println(employee.getPlace())
}
}
```
### Scala Method Overloading
* Scala offers method overloading
```
class Maths{
 def add(a:Int, b:Int) : Int = {
  (a + b)
 }
 def add(a:Int, b:Int, c:Int) :Int = {
  (a + b + c)
 }
}
```
## scala this keyword:
* this is a keyword and used to refer current object.
```
class Employee{
    var name = ""
    var age = 0
    var place = ""
    def this(name:String, age:Int, place:String){
        this()
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
        this.place = place
    }
}
```
## Scala Inheritance
* Inheritance is an object oriented concept which is used to reusability of code. 
* We can achieve inheritance by using extends keyword.

```
class Programmer extends Employee{
 //Write code....
}
class Employee{
  var name = ""
  var age = 0
}

class Programmer extends Employee {
 var bonus = 0.0
}
```
## Scala Method Overriding
* If subclass has the same name method as defined in the parent class, it is known as method overriding
```
class Employee{
  def message(){
  }
}

class Programmer extends Employee {
 override def message(){
  println("You are a Programmer")
 }
}
```
## Scala Field Overriding:
*  mutable variable cannot be override, only immutable variables are overridden
```
class Employee{
    val age = 30
    def message(){
        
    }
}

class Programmer extends Employee{
    override val age = 40
    override def message(){
        println("You are Programmer")
    }
}

val programmer = new Programmer()
println(programmer.age)
programmer.message()
```
## Scala final keyword:
* In Scala, final is a keyword, which is used to prevent inheritance of super class members into derived class.
* We can declare final variables, methods and classes also.

## Scala Abstract Class:
* Scala class which is declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class.
* An abstract class can have abstract methods and non-abstract methods as well.
* Abstract class is used to achieve abstraction.
* Abstraction is a process in which we hide complex implementation details and show only functionality to the user.
* In scala, we can achieve abstraction by using abstract class and trait.

```
abstract class Employee{
    def getName() : String
    def getAge() :Int
}

class Manager(name:String, age:Int) extends Employee {
    def getName() : String = {
        (name)
    }
    def getAge() : Int = {
       (age)
    }
}

val manager = new Manager("Arjun", 35)
println(manager.getName)
println(manager.getAge)
```
## Scala Trait
* Scala trait is like an interface with a partial implementation. 
* Scala trait is a collection of abstract and non-abstract methods.
```
trait Shape{
    def area(x:Double) : Double
}

class Square extends Shape {
    def area(x:Double) : Double = {
        (x * x)
    }
}

val square = new Square()
val aread = square.area(10.0)

MixIns:

trait Shape{
    def area(x:Double, y:Double) : Double
}

trait Printable{
    def printShape(shape:String)
}

class Rectangle extends Shape with Printable{
    def printShape(shape:String) {
        println("The shape type is: " + shape)
    }
    def area(x:Double, y:Double) : Double = {
        (x * y)
    }
}

val rectangle = new Rectangle()
rectangle.printShape("Rectangle")
val area = rectangle.area(10.0, 20.0)
println("Area of rectangle is: " + area)

``` 
***********************
## Scala Arrays:
* Scala array is a collection of mutable values.
* Index starts from 0 and last index is n-1
* Scala arrays are generic i.e., Array[T]
* Scala arrays are compatiable with Scala Sequences
* Scala supports two types of arrays:
  * One dimensional
  * Multi dimensional
### One Dimensional Array:
```
val varName:Array[arrayType] = new Array[arrayType](arraySize)
val varName = new Array[arrayType](arraySize)
val varName:Array[arrayType] = new Array(arraySize)
val varName = Array(e1,e2,e3,....eN)

val names = Array("Naga", "Ravi", "Kiran")
val numbers = new Array[Int](10)

for(i <- 0 until 10){
    numbers(i) = i
}

for(num <- numbers){
    println(num)
}

```
### Multi Dimensional Array:
```
var arrayName = Array.ofDim[ArrayType](r,c)   //r = rows, c = columns
var arrayName = Array(Array(e1,e2...eN), Array(e1, e2, ....eN))

val matrix = Array.ofDim[Int](2,2)
matrix(0)(0) = 1
matrix(0)(1) = 2
matrix(1)(0) = 3
matrix(1)(1) = 4

println(matrix(1)(1))

val persons = Array(Array("Naga", "Ravi"), Array(30, 33))
println(persons(0)(0))
println(persons(0)(1))
println(persons(1)(0))
```
**********************
## Scala Strings:
* In Scala, string is a combination of characters or we can say it is a sequence of characters.
* Strings are immutable
* We can manipulate string and can apply method to get desire results.
* We can't change original string object.
```
val firstName = "Arjun"
val surName = "A"
val name = firstName + " " + surName
val fullName = firstName.concat(surName)
println(name)
println(fullName)

String Comparision:

val name = "Naga"
val name1 = "Naga"
if(name == name1){
    println("Equal")
}else{
    println("Not Equal")
}

String Interpolation:

val name = "Naga"
println("Name: " + name)
println(s"Name: $name")

var message = raw"naga\t30\tbangalore\n"
println(message)
```
***********************
## Scala Exceptiona Handling:
* Exception handling is a mechanism which is used to handle abnormal conditions.
* We can avoid termination of your program unexpectedly.
* Scala doesn't have checked exceptions.
* All Exceptions are unchecked exceptions.
```
class Maths{
    def divide(nums:Array[Int]){
          for(num <- nums){
            try{
            val division = 100 / num
            println(division)
            }catch{
            case ae:ArithmeticException => println(ae.getMessage())
            case e:Exception => println(e.getMessage())
            }
            finally{  
            println("Finaly block always executes")  
        }  
        }   
    }
}

val math = new Maths()
val numbers = Array(1,2,3,4,5,0,6,7,8,9)
math.divide(numbers)

Scala throw keyword: The throw keyword mainly used to throw custom exception.

class Vote{
    def validate(age:Int){
        if(age <= 18){
            throw new ArithmeticException("You are not eligible for voting!")
        }else{
            println("You are eligible for voting!")
        }
    }
}

val vote = new Vote()
vote.validate(12)

Scala throws Keyword: We can declare exception with method definition using throws keyword.

class StrToNum{
    @throws(classOf[NumberFormatException])
    def strToNum(number:String){
        val num:Int = number.toInt
        println(num)
    }
}
val sn = new StrToNum()
sn.strToNum("ABC")

```
